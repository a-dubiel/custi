	  <h1>A Flight to Remember</h1>
<p>Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Kids have names?</p>
<h2>Godfellas</h2>
<p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Fatal. Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</li>
<li>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</li>
<li>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</li>
<li>Kids have names?</li>
</ul>
<h3>I Second That Emotion</h3>
<p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Noooooo! Belligerent and numerous. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
<h4>A Tale of Two Santas</h4>
<p>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Ow, my spirit! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who am I making this out to?</li>
<li>It's toe-tappingly tragic!</li>
<li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Bend Her</h5>
<p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Tell her she looks thin. Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. No, just a regular mistake.</p>
